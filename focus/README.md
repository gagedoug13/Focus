# Focus

Focus is a Native app that helps users train their focus by entering a focus subject and selecting a time in which they wish to focus for. Upon completing a task, the Android or OIS device will vibrate and return to the main screen. This project was built in React Native, using things like React Hooks, ES6, and Expo.
